# SurvivAR #
This is an AR survival game where you are placed in the center of a battleground with a demon coming towards you from a random direction. If the demon gets close enough to touch you, you die. 

The only way to survive is to shoot the demon. However, every shot taken releases another demon into the battleground. So choose your shots wisely.

If you find yourself in a sticky situation, you have one special ability: you can freeze the demons in place for 5 seconds. This gives you a chance to orient yourself into a better position for survival. The ability does take some time to refresh, so only use it when you're in trouble.

## Leaderboard Rankings ##
Each battleground is timed and the number of kills are counted. From the menu screen, you can access a leaderboard that lists the bests rounds ever played on the device, sorted by either round length or number of kills.

## Share Your Rounds ##
To go beyond just tracking the number of kills and the length of each battleground you play, each round is also recorded. After you die, you'll have the opportunity to replay the recording, save it, and share it with others. If you decide you don't want it, the app deletes it for you automatically so it doesn't waste any memory.

## Multiple Accounts ##
The app conveniently allows you add multiple accounts to be played with. So if you have a child without a phone, or are with someone who would like to quickly try the application before downloading it to their own device, you can create them an account and that way their battlegrounds won't affect your account's history, statistics, or leaderboard rankings.

## Supported Devices ##
SurvivAR is built with the help of ARKit, which, according to the [Apple website](https://www.apple.com/ca/ios/augmented-reality/), "requires an iOS device with iOS 11 and an A9 processor or later". This limits the use of SurvivAR to the iPhone SE or newer, and any iPad released in 2016 or later. However, I have only tested it with the iPhone SE at the time of writing this.
